# Intermezzo Patcher
Script for automating Intermezzo patchers.

Setup and requirements (in order):
1. Install Python using the website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Do not use any other method of installing.
2. Install the requests module with the command "pip install requests" in a console.
3. Install 7zip (if not already) and add it to PATH. This can be done by adding the location where 7zip is installed under Environment Variables > User Variables > Path > Edit > New. Save all screens once this is completed.
4. Install Wiimms SZS Tools and make sure it is added to PATH.

Usage:
1. Put your ISO/WBFS next to the script files. An optional patch2.tar can be added if you want to customise your build.
2. Start "Intermezzo.py" and follow the instructions.
